					</div>
					<div>
						<span class='onaroll'>2nd Chance War</span> is a new table game for Casinos based on the game War.
					</div>
					<br>
					<div>
						<span class="onaroll">2nd Chance War</span> is a card game in which patrons and the Dealer initially receive one card. Each patron will have a <strong>2nd Chance</strong> opportunity to discard the first card dealt to them or they may stand. The Dealer will also have a <strong>2nd Chance</strong> opportunity to discard the first card dealt, however, unlike the patron option, it is based on a predetermined set of drawing rules. The final high card wins after each patron's card is compared to the Dealer's final card. The patron may "Go to War" against the Dealer when the final card of the patron and the Dealer are of equal rank with the exception of a Seven/Seven tie.
					</div>
					<br>
					<div>
						<span class="subHeading">Card Rankings</span>
						<span>Cards used in <span class="onaroll">2nd Chance War</span>, ranked in order of lowest to highest are: Ace, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Eight, Nine, Ten, Jack, Queen and King. An Ace is always low. The Seven is an immunity card and has no rank. </span>
					</div>
					<br>
					<div>
						<span class="subHeading">Definitions</span>
						<div><strong>Immunity Seven:</strong> When a patron's final card is a Seven during regular play or after "Going to "War", the hand has immunity and cannot lose, it can only Win or Push. If the final card of the Dealer is lower than the Seven, the patron's final hand will Win and if the Dealer's final card is higher than the Seven, the hand will Push.</div>
						<br>
						<div>When a Dealer's final card is a Seven during regular play or after "Going to "War", the hand has immunity and cannot lose, it can only Win or Push. If the final card of the patron's is lower than the Seven, the Dealer's final hand will Win and if the patron's final card is higher than the Seven, the hand will Push.</div>
						<br>
						<div>When both the patron's and Dealer's final card is a Seven, in either the initial round or the "War" round, both hands are immune from losing and the hand is a Push. If this occurs during the initial round, the patron does not have the option to "Go to War". </div>
						<br>
						<div><strong>Lucky Seven Side Bet</strong> is an optional side wager that can only be placed at the beginning of the round. The patron must place a regular wager in order to place a <strong>Lucky Seven</strong> wager. Patrons are wagering that their final card and/or the Dealer's final card will be a Seven. </div>
						<br>
						<div>
							<strong>Tie Side Bet</strong> is an optional side wager that can only be placed at the beginning of the round and/or prior to "Going to War". The patron must place a regular wager in order to place a Tie wager. Tie wagers win if the Dealer's final card and the patron's final card are of equal rank. This includes a 7-7 tie. When the patron and Dealer hands Tie at any score other than 7, the patron may:
							<ol>
								<li>Surrender one half of their initial wager to the house to end the game or;</li>
								<li>Elect to <strong>"Go To War"</strong> by surrendering their initial wager and making a "War" wager, equal to their initial wager.</li>
							</ol>
						</div>
						<br>
						<div>
							<strong>Patron Drawing Rules:</strong> After each patron has received their first card face up, each patron will have a <strong>2nd Chance</strong> opportunity to discard their first card and steal the Dealer's card or they may stand. A patron may use their <strong>2nd Chance</strong> opportunity and steal the Dealer's card once during the regular round and once during the "War" round, regardless of the rank of the card.
						</div>
						<br>
						<div>
							<strong>Dealer's Drawing Rules:</strong> If the first card dealt to the Dealer is a Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, Jack, Queen or King, the Dealer must stand and cannot draw. If the first card dealt to the Dealer is an Ace, Two, Three, Four, Five or Six, the Dealer must use his <strong>2nd Chance</strong> opportunity and draw one more card regardless of the outcome. This applies during the "War" round as well.
