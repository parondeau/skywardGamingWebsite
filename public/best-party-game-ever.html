							Informal gatherings often get off to a slow start, right? Guests standing around with others they know. Newcomers off
							to the side, limiting eye contact. Not anymore! I’ve created a fun way to “break the ice”, “get the party started” and put
							everyone in a great mood!
            </br>
						</br>
							Best Party Game Ever is a fun and interactive game for as many as 20 people of all ages. The game is simple, can
							be customized to suit your guests, has a different outcome every time and can be played on any flat surface where
							players can sit or stand.
            </br>
            </br>
							Soon after the game begins, you’ll notice people getting better acquainted, competing, offering advice, laughing,
							cheering and sometimes sighing! By the end of the game, everyone is mingling and talking about what a good time
							they had!
            </br>
            </br>
							And Best Party Game Ever is not only for home use. Imagine it at work in the lunch &amp; break areas, conference room
							or at a company function. Use its team building powers to bring employees together as they rely on each other’s
							creativity, dexterity and competitiveness to assemble the winning masterpiece.

        <h3>How To Play <span class="onarollHeader">Best Party Game Ever</span></h3>
        <b>Object of the Game</b>
        </br>
        <div>To build a tower using different sized geometric shaped game pieces without it collapsing.</div>
        </br>
        <b>Game Parts</b>
        </br>
        <div>Fifty-six (56) geometric shaped game pieces of varying sizes including rectangles, squares, round rods, triangles, full and half rings.</div>
        </br>
        <div>Three (3) larger rectangle game blocks are to be used as the base for the tower.</div>
        </br>
        <b>The Set-Up</b>
        </br>
        <div>The game is for players of all ages. You can play individually or create teams. Place up to 3 base rectangle game blocks on any flat surface ensuring they touch each other and are accessible from all angles. Scatter the other game	pieces around the playing surface.</div>
        </br>
        <b>How to Play</b>
        </br>
        <div>Begin by choosing the starting player using whatever criteria you like e.g. shortest, tallest, oldest, youngest, etc. and
					specify the order of play. e.g. clockwise. Every player must remember who they follow. Each player chooses a game
					piece and places it on the top of a base block or another game piece. The turn moves to the next person or team
					member.</div>
        </br>
        <b>Rules</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Place your game piece anywhere on the base structure or on any other existing game piece;</li>
          <li>If a game piece shifts, the play continues provided none of the game pieces fall;</li>
          <li>Your turn is complete 1) after the game piece is placed on the tower without any pieces falling 2) the tower remains stable for a minimum of 5 seconds;</li>
          <li>If any part of the tower collapses or an existing game piece falls, the player responsible is out of the game. Any fallen game pieces not still on the base are removed from the area and put back into play; the game continues with the next player;</li>
          <li>If the tower collapses on its own 1) after the 5 second minimum or 2) due to wind, a table bump, etc.) the game continues with fallen game pieces put back into play</li>
        </ul>
        </br>
        <b>Winning The Game</b>
        </br>
        <div>The last player to successfully place a game piece on the tower wins the game. If all of the game pieces have been placed, all remaining players win the game.</div>
        </br>
        <b>Variations</b>
        </br>
        <ul>
          <li>Use a timer if you like and set it as desired to add a dimension of urgency.</li>
          <li>Assembly may be made more difficult by removing one of the three base game blocks.</li>
          <li>At the start of the game, divide the game pieces evenly amongst all players or teams.</li>
          <li>For team play, consider blindfolding a partner, relying on verbal commands only to guide the placement of game pieces.</li>
        </ul>
