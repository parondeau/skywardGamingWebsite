            <span class='onaroll'>On A Roll Dice Poker</span> is an exciting new poker game played with five dice that are numbered from one to six.
            Players compete against a pay table, not against the Dealer or other players.
          </div>
          <br>
          <div>
            A player must make at least one <strong>Dice Poker</strong> wager on any of the seven combinations. It is a mandatory one-roll wager that wins if the combination is rolled and it loses if it is not rolled.
          </div>
          <br>
          <div>
            A player may also make an optional side wager on the <span class="zilch">Zilch</span> side bet. This optional wager can be placed anytime the "Off" button is in use. The player must place a <strong>Dice Poker</strong> wager in order to place a <span class="zilch">Zilch</span> wager. Players are wagering that the Shooter will roll <span class="zilch">Zilch</span> or nothing. If achieved, players have a guaranteed payout and qualify for the 5 Sixes Bonus Round
          </div>
          <br>
          <div>
            The <strong>5 Sixes Bonus Round</strong> is a completely separate bonus round where each player has the opportunity at an additional payout if the Shooter can roll 5 Sixes in up to 5 rolls. After each roll the Dealer removes each six that has been rolled. The Shooter continues rolling the remaining dice until 5 Sixes is achieved or for 5 rolls, whichever comes first.
          </div>
          <br>
          <div>
            The <strong>Shooter</strong> is the player with control of the dice. This player may continue to shake the dice provided they wagered on the exact winning <strong>Dice Poker</strong> combination or until <span class="zilch">Zilch</span> is rolled and the <strong>5 Sixes Bonus Round</strong> is completed. Until a player elects to become the Shooter, the Dealer shakes the dice.

            <img src="images/selfie.png">

          <div>
            My name is Norman Rondeau and I am the inventor of <span class="onaroll">On A Roll Dice Poker</span>. With the success of the game Trivial Pursuit in the early 1980's I, like many other inventors began to develop games that I thought would be the next big mega hit. Over the next few years I developed over 50 games and toys, made prototypes for some which I tried to market and license. Two of the games I invented, Sound F/X and Freeze Frame were presented to representatives from Mattel but unfortunately were not picked up. I stopped developing games in 1993.
          </div>
          <br>
          <div>
            Over the next 20 years, I redirected my energy raising a family, co-owning and operating the Severn River Inn as well as starting at the ground level in the casino industry working as a Dealer at Toronto Charity Casinos. I worked my way up from the position of Floor Supervisor at Casino Windsor and held a number of progressive positions at Casino Rama from Pit Manager, Shift Manager, Table Games Manager to Baccarat Room Manager, which is the position I currently have.
          </div>
          <br>
          <div>
            After being asked by the Director of Gaming Operations to write the Rules of Play for a new game submission to the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO), invented by a local resident in the Orillia area in March 2012, it inspired me to dust off the old game concepts and get back into the game invention business. I thought, if I can write the rules of a casino game for someone else that gets approved by the AGCO then surely I can do it for myself! With 20 years of casino experience watching the transformation and introduction of new table games and listening to both employees and customers alike I was inspired to create a new casino game loosely based on a dice game I had been playing with my family at the kitchen table for about 25 years.
          </div>
          <br>
          <div>
            In November, 2012 I pitched a new dice game concept to Gaming Operations Executives Glenn Trickey and John Drake. They assured me that if I could write the Rules of Play submission to the AGCO, Casino Rama would submit, sponsor and trial the game on the floor. I wrote the rules, they were submitted in July and approved in November 2013. The game will be launched and go live on the floor in March 2014. I will always be grateful and thankful to these two executives for demonstrating our Progressive and Achievement Core Value. They are committed to creating and maintaining a work environment where opportunities for creativity, innovation and continuous improvement is recognized and celebrated.
