				<h3>The Story of <span class="onarollHeader">On A Roll Dice Poker</span></h3>

					<div>
						My name is Norman Rondeau and I am a game inventor.
						With the success of the game Trivial Pursuit in the early 1980's I,
						like many other inventors began to develop games that I thought
						would be the next big mega hit. Over the next few years I developed
						over 50 games and toys, made prototypes for some which I tried to
						market and license. Two of the games I invented, Sound F/X and Freeze
						Frame were presented to representatives from Mattel but unfortunately
						were not picked up. I stopped developing games in 1993.
					</div>
					<br>
					<div>
						Over the next 20 years, I redirected my energy raising a family, co-owning and
						operating the Severn River Inn as well as starting at the ground level in the
						casino industry working as a Dealer at Toronto Charity Casinos. I worked my way
						up from the position of Floor Supervisor at Casino Windsor and held a number of
						progressive positions at Casino Rama from Pit Manager, Shift Manager, Table
						Games Manager to Baccarat Room Manager, which is the position I currently have.
					</div>
					<br>
					<div>
						After being asked by the Director of Gaming Operations to write the Rules of Play
						for a new game submission to the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario
						(AGCO), invented by a local resident in the Orillia area in March 2012, it inspired
						me to dust off the old game concepts and get back into the game invention
						business. I thought, if I can write the rules of a casino game for someone else
						that gets approved by the AGCO then surely I can do it for myself! With 20 years
						of casino experience watching the transformation and introduction of new table
						games and listening to both employees and customers alike I was inspired to
						create a new casino game loosely based on a dice game I had been playing with
						my family at the kitchen table for about 25 years.
					</div>
					<br>
					<div>
						In November, 2012 I pitched a new dice game concept to Gaming Operations
						Executives Glenn Trickey and John Drake. The casino game is called
						<span class="onaroll">On A Roll Dice Poker</span>. They assured me that if I could write
						the Rules of Play submission to the AGCO, Casino Rama would submit,
						sponsor and trial the game on the floor. I wrote the rules,
						they were submitted in July and approved in November 2013. I
						will always be grateful and thankful to these two executives for demonstrating our
						Progressive and Achievement Core Value. They are committed to creating and
						maintaining a work environment where opportunities for creativity, innovation and
						continuous improvement is recognized and celebrated.

					<br>
					<div>
						<span class="subHeading">Field Trial at Casino Rama</span>
						<span>
							<span class="onaroll">On A Roll Dice Poker</span> went live on the floor from May to September 2014.
							The feedback from Dealers, Supervisors and Pit Bosses who dealt or oversaw
							the operation of the game had nothing but positive comments about how fun it
							was deal and watch the interaction amongst the Players. Since the game is so
							unique some customers that did play the game, at first looked puzzled over all of
							the circles on the layout but after a quick 5-minute lesson began playing and
							really enjoying being able to shake the dice for themselves and get a chance to
							roll Zilch and play the 5 Sixes Bonus Round. There was multiple players who
							rolled 5 Of A Kind in one roll which paid 1200 to 1. On one occasion, one player
							wagered $15 and won $18,000. There were certainly a lot of cheers and high
							fives all around the table.
						</span>
						<br>
						<span>
							The purpose of a Field Trial is for a casino to review the performance and
							profitability of a new game. Since casino floor space is at a premium, all games
							whether they are traditional or new need to reach and maintain a certain level of
							profitability otherwise they are removed from the gaming floor. In spite of the
							many positive reviews from employees and customers alike,
							<span class="onaroll">On A Roll Dice Poker</span> did not meet the
							minimum revenue requirements at Casino Rama.
						</span>
					</div>
					<br>
					<div>
						<span class="subHeading">A New Way To Play!</span>
						<span>
							After reviewing the financial performance of the game it became clear that a
							change to the game needed to be made to reduce the volatility of the game. To
							that end, I modified the wagering options and created new pay table options that
							make the game less susceptible for a casino while making the game even easier
							to learn and more fun  to play.
						</span>
						<br>
						<span>
							I am currently looking to place this game in a casino for a Field Trial.

						<span class="subHeading">The Next Big Mega Hit!</span>
						<span>
							With the excitement and pride of placing a new casino game onto a casino floor
							and watching customers playing and interacting with one another my creative
							juices started flowing again. Every day that I walked the casino floor I would
							make observations of customers as they played, the look on their faces when
							they won, lost and how they related to the Dealer and one another. I kept thinking
							about what makes a casino game popular. Is it a game like Blackjack or Baccarat
							that have a low house advantage? Are customers looking for a chance at winning
							a big progressive jackpot? Are players attracted to games where there is social
							interaction amongst the other players and staff? The answer is all of the above.
						</span>
						<br>
						<br>
						<span>
							While practising darts and staring at the bull's-eye in September 2014 I had a
							EUREKA moment and thought "what a great idea"  combine Blackjack with a
							Bull's-Eye concept and low and behold, my next casino game <span class="onaroll">Blackjack Bull's-
							Eye</span> was born!
						</span>
						<br>
						<br>
						<span>
							<span class="onaroll">Blackjack Bull's-Eye</span> is a side bet for the casino table game of Blackjack. The
							game is played using an automated dice shaker, and two dice. After placing a
							wager on the <span class="onaroll">Blackjack Bull's-Eye</span> side bet a player will win if the <strong>Lucky Spot</strong>,
							the <strong>Lucky Total</strong> or a <strong>Bull's-Eye</strong> is achieved.
						</span>
						<br>
						<br>
						<span>
							I have copyrighted the name of the game as well have a Patent Pending in
							Canada and the United States. I am currently looking to place this game in a
							casino for a Field Trial.
						</span>
						<br>
						<br>
						<span>
							After making observations of the game Casino War for years at Casino Rama
							where I work, I started thinking that although it is the simplest of casino games to
							learn and it attracts "first time Table Games players it is in serious need of some
							"fun and excitement".
						</span>
						<br>
						<br>
						<span>
							I wanted to create a similar game to Casino War but with more twists and
							exciting side bets offering big payouts..After watching the disappointing reactions
							of customers on the existing game, when they received a small card, knowing
							they all but lost their bet, I thought to myself "why not give customers a second
							chance where they can discard their card for a new one". to that end,
							<span class="onaroll">2nd Chance War</span> was created.
						</span>
						<br>
						<br>
						<span>
							I also introduced some rules from card games I played at home like "Pass the
							Ace " which allows players to "steal" the Dealer's card and I made any Seven a
							pivotal card in the game because it has immunity and cannot lose. I also
							increased the payout on the Tie bet if the pair is suited and introduced a fun and
							excited Lucky Seven side bet.
						</span>
						<br>
						<br>
						<span>
							I have copyrighted the name of the game as well have a Patent Pending in
							Canada and the United States. I am currently looking to place this game in a
							casino for a Field Trial.
